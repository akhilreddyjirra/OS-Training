# A Simple PHP Example
Let's take some time to build a simple PHP example. Using PHP will make it easy
for us to demonstrate persistent storage.

## Create a PHP Project
As `alice`, create a project called `php-upload`.

## Build the App
The source code for the application is here:

    https://github.com/thoraxe/openshift-php-upload-demo

Using the skills you've learned so far, get this code running in your new
project. Remember that you'll have to select the PHP builder (if you use the
WebUI). Call this new application/service "demo".

## Create a Route
Using the skills you've learned so far, use the `expose` subcommand to create a
route for your app. If you used the WebUI, make sure you created a default
route.

## Visit the Application
Once your code is built, visit your application. Your URL probably looks
something like:

    http://demo-php-upload.cloudapps.example.com/

There should be a file picker and an upload button. Try to upload something and
see what happens.

## Error!
You are not allowed to upload a file. This is because the area of the Docker
image where the applicaion content lives (`/opt/app-root/src/`) is not writeable
by the user that is running the PHP process.

As `alice` in a terminal, make sure you are using the `php-upload` project
(that's what you called it, right?) and then find the name of your demo pod.
Then, do the following:

    oc exec demo-1-kly7h -- sh -c 'whoami; ls -al'
    whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1000100000
    total 24
    drwxr-xr-x. 3 default default 4096 Sep 15 14:36 .
    drwxr-xr-x. 4 default default 4096 Sep  8 12:41 ..
    -rw-r--r--. 1 default default  365 Sep 15 14:36 index.html
    -rw-r--r--. 1 default default   20 Sep 15 14:36 info.php
    -rw-r--r--. 1 default default  700 Sep 15 14:36 upload.php
    drwxr-xr-x. 2 default default 4096 Sep 15 14:36 uploaded

You can see that the user you are (1000100000) is not who owns the `uploaded`
folder (`default`). And the `uploaded` folder does not have world-writeable
permissions.

But, that's OK, because we're going to add storage to our application
containers.

## Export Another NFS Volume
Earlier in the labs you created an NFS export to store your Docker registry
data. We're going to add another one for use with this PHP application. On your
*master* and as `root`:

1. Create the directory we will export:

        mkdir -p /var/export/vol1
        chown nobody:nobody /var/export/vol1
        chmod 777 /var/export/vol1

1. Edit `/etc/exports` and add the following line:

        /var/export/vol1 *(rw,sync,all_squash)

1. Execute `exportfs -r` to tell NFS to refresh its exports.

You can validate that your new export is there with the following:

    showmount -e
    Export list for ose3-master.example.com:
    /var/export/vol1   *
    /var/export/regvol *

## Create a PersistentVolume
Much like with the registry, it's up to an administrator to create a
PersistentVolume. The following JSON definition can be found in
`content/php-volume.json`:

    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "kind": "PersistentVolume",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "php-volume"
      },
      "spec": {
        "capacity": {
            "storage": "3Gi"
            },
        "accessModes": [ "ReadWriteMany" ],
        "nfs": {
            "path": "/var/export/vol1",
            "server": "ose3-master.example.com"
        }
      }
    }

As the `root` user, go ahead and create this volume:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/php-volume.json

## Create a PersistentVolumeClaim
Once the volume is created, a project needs to claim it, much like with the
registry. There is a claim in `content/php-claim.json` that looks like:

    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "kind": "PersistentVolumeClaim",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "php-claim"
      },
      "spec": {
        "accessModes": [ "ReadWriteMany" ],
        "resources": {
          "requests": {
            "storage": "3Gi"
          }
        }
      }
    }

As `alice` and in the *php-upload* project, go ahead and create this claim:

    oc create -f ~/training/content/php-claim.json

If you accidentally do this as *root* or in the wrong project, you might see a
strange error in the pod when it comes up about the volume. Make sure you create
this claim in the *php-upload* project. Claims and volumes can be deleted and
recreated just like other objects. So, if you create the claim in the wrong
place, just delete it and recreate it.

## Add the Volume to Your DeploymentConfig
Much like we did with the registry, it's pretty easy for a user to tell
OpenShift how to use a storage volume with an application. Our friend the `oc
volume` command comes back to our rescue. As `alice` you can do the following:

    oc volume dc/demo --add -t pvc --claim-name php-claim \
    -m /opt/app-root/src/uploaded --name=php-volume

This command tells OpenShift:

* modify the DeploymentConfig to add a volume
* use the persistent volume claim called `php-claim`
* give the volume the name `php-volume`
* and mount it at `/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`

When you make this change, you will see that OpenShift will increment the
version of the deployment configuration:

    oc get dc
    NAME      TRIGGERS                    LATEST VERSION
    demo      ConfigChange, ImageChange   2

And we will get a new replication controller that has a pod template with the
new volume information. Ultimately, we'll get a new pod:

    oc get pod
    NAME           READY     STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
    demo-1-build   0/1       ExitCode:0   0          3h
    demo-2-9ti4f   1/1       Running      0          3h

Once your new pod is running, try to upload a file again. Does it work? Do you
see your file on your master system at `/var/export/vol1`? You can access your
file via this application by going to:

    http://demo-php-upload.cloudapps.example.com/uploaded

You should see a directory index of all of the uploaded files and be able to
access your file. Neat!
