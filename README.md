# OpenShift "Training"
This repository provides instructions for how to set up a basic OpenShift 3.X
environment. It contains various examples of using OpenShift 3.X. The table of
contents below provides links to the various chapters.

The material operates under an expectation of a fairly specific setup. If your
setup diverges significantly from this expected setup, you may need to make
significant modifications to the material.

**NOTE:** Currently OpenShift is at 3.0.1 and this material has not yet been
completely updated for it. Your mileage may vary. There are various dead links
and other paths-to-nowhere that are in the process of being updated/validated.
